# OS Virtual Labs

This repository contains the source code for OS Virtual Labs, a web application built using React and Flask. The objective of this project is to provide a virtual environment for users to practice and learn about operating systems concepts through interactive simulations and exercises. 

## Tools and Technologies Used

The following tools and technologies were used to develop this project:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Flask: A Python web framework for building server-side applications.
- HTML/CSS: Used for structuring and styling the web pages.
- JavaScript: Used for client-side scripting.
- Python: Used for server-side scripting and backend development.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes and collaboration.
- GitHub: Hosting platform for the source code repository.

## Source Code

The source code for this project is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/retr0-kernel/OS-Virtual-Labs](https://github.com/retr0-kernel/OS-Virtual-Labs). It is organized into the following directories:

- `frontend`: Contains the React components and UI-related files.
- `backend`: Contains the Flask application and server-side logic.
- `public`: Includes the static assets and the HTML entry point.
- `src`: Contains the JavaScript and CSS files used by the frontend.

## Sample Output

A live demo of the OS Virtual Labs web application can be accessed at [https://os-virtual-labs.com](https://os-virtual-labs.com). The website allows users to interact with various simulations and exercises related to operating systems. Users can explore different scenarios, perform tasks, and receive feedback within the virtual environment.

## Future Work

There are several potential areas for future development and improvement of the OS Virtual Labs project. Some possible enhancements include:

- Adding more simulations and exercises to cover a wider range of operating system concepts.
- Implementing a user authentication system to track progress and provide personalized learning experiences.
- Enhancing the user interface to improve usability and visual appeal.
- Integrating additional tools and technologies to enhance the learning experience.
- Incorporating a feedback system to gather user suggestions and improve the overall quality of the application.
